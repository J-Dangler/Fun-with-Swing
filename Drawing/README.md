# Fun-with-Swing
**Created by Jacob Dangler and Francis Hayse**


This project was made with the intent to demonstrate the advantages of Swift in Java

When a user desires to start our application, they must download the three files above and run the SwingPaint file.

Once ran, the user will be prompted with a 1080 by 840 pixel window that will be named Paint 2.

Inside of Paint 2, the user will be able to choose from a number of options to fit their drawing needs.

Paint 2 will start at default with 3 tools autoselected: Color Black, Pencil Shape, and Stroke size of 1.

If the user wants to change tools, they may do so by clicking the button they enjoy, and, if the user is unfamiliar with a tool, they may hover over the questioned button to view a ToolTip..

The clear button is also located in our tools area, and this button may be clicked whenever they wish to clear their page.

Hovering over this will also display the wonderful creators of this drawing application.
